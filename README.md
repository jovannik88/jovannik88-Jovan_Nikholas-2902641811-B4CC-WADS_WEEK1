How Git works ?

Git operates using a "distributed" model. This means every developer has a full copy of the project history on their own machine, rather than relying on a single central server.

How Git Operates (four areas of git):

1. Working Directory: Where you are currently making changes to your files.
2.	Staging Area (Index): A middle ground where you format and "wrap" your changes before finalizing them.
3.	Repository (Local/Remote): Where Git permanently stores the changes as a "commit" (a snapshot in time).

Git Workflow :
1. Modify: You change files in your Working Directory.
2. Stage: You run git add. This moves those changes into the Staging Area. This allows you to group related changes together even if you edited 10 different files.
3. Commit: You run git commit. Git takes everything in the Staging Area and wraps it into a permanent snapshot with a message. This is now safely stored in your Local Repository.
4 .Push: You run git push. This sends your local commits to a Remote Repository for safekeeping or collaboration
