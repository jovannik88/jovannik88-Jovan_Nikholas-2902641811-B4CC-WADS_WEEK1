How Git works ?

Git operates using a "distributed" model. This means every developer has a full copy of the project history on their own machine, rather than relying on a single central server.

How Git Operates (four areas of git):

1. Working Directory: Where you are currently making changes to your files.
2.	Staging Area (Index): A middle ground where you format and "wrap" your changes before finalizing them.
3.	Repository (Local/Remote): Where Git permanently stores the changes as a "commit" (a snapshot in time).
