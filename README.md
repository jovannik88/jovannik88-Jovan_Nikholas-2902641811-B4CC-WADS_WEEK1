What is Git?

Git is is a version control system that tracks every change made to files over time, allowing you to revisit any previous state of your project if things go south.

Git History :

In 2005, the Linux Kernel was being managed using a proprietary tool called BitKeeper. The company behind BitKeeper offered it to the Linux team for free, but a licensing dispute broke out when a Linux developer tried to reverse-engineer the BitKeeper protocols.

BitKeeper's owner got angry and revoked the free license. This left Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in a massive bind. He hated all the other existing version control systems (like CVS or SVN), famously saying they were examples of "exactly what not to do."

So, he did what any genius would do: he took a one-week "vacation" to write his own tool from scratch.
